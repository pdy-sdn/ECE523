This project will involve studying the alpha parameter of typical reinforced concrete high rise core wall buildings. 
The alpha parameters are obtained from the modal analysis of full 3D buildings of the case study buildings.
Correlations between different building parameters are studied. 
It is found that the selected index parameter GA/EI is the best predictor of the α.
Finally, a linear model based on GA/EI index is developed to predict α.
